### Analysis

* From the bar graph analysis, it can be said that maximum number of mice are tested for drugs 'Capomulin' and 'Ramicane'.
* The tests performed on mice has 51% of male mice and 49% of female mice.
* It is found that the final tumor volume of mice treated with 'Capomulin' and 'Ramicane' drugs was very less compared to final tumor volume of mice tested with 'Infubinol' and 'Ceftamin' drugs.(almost 20 mm3 less)
* After treating mouse l509 with 'Capomulin' drug, there is a slight increase in tumor volume initially but after few timepoints, decrease in the tumour volume can be observed.
* The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen drug is 0.84. There is a positive corelation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume in this case.
